    <h1>About Chicago Budget Explorer</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>What is this tool?</h2>
      <p>
        The Chicago Budget Explorer is an open-source civic tech project that makes
        Chicago's operating budget transparent, interactive, and understandable. Explore
        where $16.6 billion in tax dollars go and simulate your own budget scenarios.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>
        All budget data comes from the official City of Chicago Open Data Portal via the
        Socrata API. We use the published budget ordinance appropriations datasets, which
        represent the legally approved budget passed by City Council.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>FY2025 Data</strong>: Budget - 2025 Budget Ordinance - Appropriations
          (Dataset ID: t59y-fr3k)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FY2024 Data</strong>: Budget - 2024 Budget Ordinance - Appropriations
          (Dataset ID: x394-e874)

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>Our data pipeline:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fetches raw data from Chicago's Socrata portal</li>
        <li>Aggregates line items by department (5,000+ rows → ~50 departments)</li>
        <li>Calculates fund breakdowns and subcategories</li>
        <li>
          Validates that departmental totals sum correctly (within $1 tolerance for
          rounding)
        </li>
        <li>Generates JSON files consumed by this website</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All code is open source and available on GitHub. You can verify our
        transformations and run the pipeline yourself.
      </p>

      <h2>Simulation Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The budget simulator applies realistic constraints based on how municipal budgets
        work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-adjustable Departments</strong>: Debt service and pension payments
          are legally mandated and cannot be reduced
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grant-Funded Departments</strong>: Departments with significant grant
          funding have tighter adjustment ranges (grants can't be easily redirected)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjustment Range</strong>: Most departments can be adjusted 50%-150% of
          their current budget
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This tool is for educational and informational purposes only. While we strive for
        accuracy, budget data is complex and subject to change. Always verify important
        information with official city sources. The simulator is a simplified model and
        does not account for all real-world budget constraints, legal requirements, and
        political considerations.
